### In pursuit of a career, many people do not realize how important a healthy lifestyle is, the lack of which carries many unpleasant consequences that may end tragically for them. Lack of physical activity (sedentary lifestyle), party lifestyle (stimulants), unhealthy diet associated with hardened fats and white sugar or neglecting periodic examinations are just some of the reasons that can result in many diseases, one of which is diseases related to the most important organ in the human body, responsible for pumping blood to other organs, i.e. the heart.

### Heart disease disrupts the entire circulatory system, and the risk of developing them increases with age. We can replace min. such disadvantages as:

* ischemic heart disease (coronary artery disease),

* heart failure (acute, chronic),

* atrioventricular conduction block,

* myocarditis,

* pericarditis or endocarditis,

* valvular defects,

* cardiac neurosis.

### The main motivation for creating the program was our health and the attempt to anticipate heart disease, which may be directly related to other parameters of our body's work. As an athlete, I am aware of the great problem of fainting disorders caused by unknown heart diseases that can lead to death.
